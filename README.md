# Convolutional-neural-network-CNN-for-image-classification
In this code, we start by loading the pre-trained VGG16 model, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset for image classification. We freeze the pre-trained layers to prevent them from being updated during training, and add custom classification layers on top of the pre-trained model.

We compile the model using the compile method, and load a custom dataset of images using the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras. We use data augmentation techniques to generate additional training data and prevent overfitting.

We then fine-tune the model on the custom dataset using the fit method, and evaluate the accuracy of the model on a test dataset using the evaluate method.

Finally, we save the trained model to a file using the save method for later use.
